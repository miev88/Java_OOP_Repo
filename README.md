# Learning OOP with Java

In this repository you will find the projects that I have implemented from scratch in order to learn OOP in Java.


# The Hangman game

The main is located in LogicControl.java

1) After downloading the source files and the text file in one directory, access that directory from the command line.
2) Type in the cmd: javac LogicControl.java (If you see nothing but the next system prompt, everything is good!)
3) Type in the cmd: java LogicControl
4) Enjoy the game!


# Compare the cost of launching two different rocket types to Mars

Compile and run the file (see above). The main is located in Main.java
